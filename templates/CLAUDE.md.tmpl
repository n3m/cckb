## Project Knowledge Base (CCKB)

This project uses Claude Code Knowledge Base for persistent project context.

### Vault Location
`cc-knowledge-base/vault/`

### Usage Guidelines

1. **Before creating new entities/services:**
   - Check vault INDEX.md for existing patterns
   - Review related entity structures in `/vault/entities/`
   - Follow established architecture in `/vault/architecture.md`

2. **When uncertain about project conventions:**
   - Consult `/vault/general-knowledge.md`
   - Check entity-specific INDEX.md files
   - Ask user if not found in vault

3. **Sparse Loading:**
   - Start with INDEX.md files only
   - Deep-load specific files only when needed
   - Never load entire vault at once

4. **Context from hooks:**
   - CCKB hooks will automatically inject relevant context
   - Trust injected context for immediate decisions
   - Verify with vault files for complex decisions
